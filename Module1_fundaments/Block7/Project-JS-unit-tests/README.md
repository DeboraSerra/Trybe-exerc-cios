# Project JS Unit Tests

This project was ment to consolidate our knowlage on unit tests using Jest.

We were oriented to write the code to the tests provided (exercises average.js, vqv.js, createStudent.js, calculator.js, arrayGenerator.js and myCounter.js) and the tests to the codes provided (exercises numbers.spec.js, circle.spec.js, productDetails.spec.js, getCharacter.spec.js). The exercise restaurant.js and its test were entirely developed by the students.

## Guidelines to develop the project

1. Implement the function _average.js_.

2. Implement the tests to the function _numbers.js_.

3. Implement the function _vqv.js_.

4. Implement the tests to the function _circle.js_.

5. Implement the function _createStudent.js_.

6. Implement the tests to the function _productDetails_.

7. Implement the functions _calculator.js_ and _arrayGenerator.js_.

8. Implement the function _myCounter.js_.
