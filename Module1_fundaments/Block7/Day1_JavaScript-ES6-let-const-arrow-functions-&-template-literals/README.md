### Part I

###### (exercise1-7.1.js)

Do the necessary modifications to the given functions so it will behave in the way it was intended.

After that, modify it's structure so it will be an arrow function.

Then, modify the concatenations to template literals.

###### (exercise2-7.1.js)

Use template literals so it will printthe message "The numbers 2,3,4,7,10,13 are ordered in crescent order!".

> Bonus: try to make the same exercise, but using the method array.sort().

### Part II

###### (exercise3-7.1.js)

Create a function that receive a number and returns its factorial.

> Bonus: try to make the same exercise in a recursive way

###### (exercise4-7.1.js)

Create a function that receives a phrase and returns the biggest word.
