#### Bonus exercises

###### (bonusExercise1-4.2.js)

1 - Order the 'numbers' array in crescent order and print the values;

###### (bonusExercise2-4.2.js)

2 - Order the 'numbers' array in decreasing order and print the values;

###### (bonusExercise3-4.2.js)

3 - Now createa new array from the 'numbers' array, without losing it. Each value in the new array must equal to the its matching in 'numbers' array multiplied by the next one. For exemple: The first value must be 45, because it's the 5 (first value) multiplied by 9 (the next value).
In case there isn't a next value, the multiplication must be made by 2.
