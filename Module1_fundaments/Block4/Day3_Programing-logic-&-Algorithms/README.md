# Day 4-3 - JavaScript - Programing logic & Algorithms

1 - The is the multiplication of a natural number by its predecessors, exept by zero. 
Using this information, create an algorithm that return the factorial of 10.

2- Now, develop an algorithm that is able to invert a word. For exemple, the word "banana" would be inverted to "ananab". 

3- Considering the array below, write two algorithms: one that returns the biggest word and one that returns the smallest one.
> `let array = ['java', 'javascript', 'python', 'html', 'css'];`

4- A prime number is divisible only by 1 and for itself. Knowing that, write an algorithm that return the biggest prime number between 0 and 50.

#### Bonus exercises

###### (bonusExercise1-4.3.js)

1 - Now let's work with some geometric forms! Make a program that, given an _n_ number biggest than 1, print on the screen a square made of _*_ with a width of _n_ and a line of _n_. For exemple:

> n = 5
```
*****
*****
*****
*****
*****
```

###### (bonusExercise2-4.3.js)

2- To the second exercise, do the same as before, but that print a rectangle triangle with 5 asterisk of base. For exemple:

> n = 5
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

###### (bonusExercise3-4.3.js)

3- Now invert the side of the triangle. For exemple:

> n = 5
```
    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
```

Warning! Note that this exercise is much more complex than the previous! Here, it isn't enough just to print the asterisk. You will need a logic to print the spaces too.

###### (bonusExercise4-4.3.js)

4- After that, make a piramid with n asterisks of base:

> n = 5
```
  *
 ***
*****
```

###### (bonusExercise5-4.3.js)

5- Make a piramid with n asteriks of base that is empty in the middle. Assume that _n_ value will be always odd. At last, make as the variable is incremented will a matching value for each loop;

> n = 7
```
   *
  * *
 *   *
*******
```

###### (bonusExercise6-4.3.js)

6- Make a program that says if a given number defined in a variable is prime or not.
