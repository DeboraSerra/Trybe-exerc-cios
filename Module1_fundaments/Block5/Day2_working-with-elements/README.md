# Day 5-2 - JavaScript - Working with elements

Starting from the code provided in the course page, we were asked to follow the exercises below:

1. Add a tag `h1` with the text _Exerc√≠cio 5.2 - JavaScript DOM_ as a child of the tag `body`;

2. Add a `main` tag with the class _main-content_ as a child of the tag `body`;

3. Add a tag `section` with the class _center-content_ as a child of the tag `main` created before;

4. Add a `p` tag as a child to the tag `section` created on step 3 and put some text;

5. Add a tag `section` with the class _left-content_ as a child to the `main` tag created on step 2;

6. Add a tag `section` with the class _right-content_ as a child to the tag main created on step 2;

7. Add an image with `src` set to: _https://picsum.photos/200_ and the class _small-image_. This element must be a child to the section created on step 5;

8. Add an unordered list with the values 1 to 10, as in, one, two, ... as values of the list. This lit must be a child for the section created on step 6;

9. Add 3 tags `h3`, all being a child to the `main` created on step 2.

Now that you created a lot of things, let's make some alterations and removals:

10. Add the class _title_ to the tag `h1` created before;

11. Add the class _description_ in all the `h3` tags;

12. Remove the section created on step 5 (the one that have the class _left-content_);

13. Center the section created on step 6 (the one that have the class _right-content_).

14. Change the background color of the parent element of the section created on step 3 (the one that have the class _center-content_) to the color green;

15. Remove the last two elements (nine and ten) of the list created on step 8.
