# Project - Pixel art

To use the Pixel art document, you must simply select the color you want on the palette and start drawing. If you want a bigger board just type the number and hit the VQV button, or press 'Enter', but the board will not be smaller than 5X5 or bigger than 50X50. If you clicked a square by mistake, click it again and the color will be removed. If you want to star again, click the 'Clear board' button.

This project was produced using the guidelines bellow. We were encouraged to refactor our projects as we want after the requisites were done.

1. Add to the page the title _Color palette_.

2. Add to the page a palette with four different colors.

> The background color of each element in the palette must be the color this element represents. The only color not allowed is white;

3. Add the color black as the first color of the palette.

4. Add to the page a pixel board with 25 pixels.

5. Each pixel element must have the size specified and a border.

6. Define the black color as the first one selected. When the page is loaded, the color black must be selected to color the pixels.

7. When you click in one of the colors of the palette, it will be selected and can be used to color the pixels.

8. When you click the pixel inside the board, the pixel will be painted with the selected color.

9. Create a button that, when it is clicked, cleans the board,making all the pixels have the background color white.

#### Bonus

10. Make so the user is able to choose the size of the board.

11. Limit the size of the board: min of 5 and max of 50 .

12. Make so the color in the palette are random when the page is loaded.
