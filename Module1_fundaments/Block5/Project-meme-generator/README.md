To use the meme generator you must choose an image or uplode one from your computer and type the text you want. If you'd like, you can also choose a margin to your foto.

To make this project, we were asked to follow the guidelines below:

> Inside the _meme-generator-container_ you must create another element to show the text typed. It must have the ID _meme-text_;

> If there is no image inserted, the text must be visible inside the empty container were the image will be.

2. The site must allow who use it to upload an image from their computer.

> Inside the container element, you must create another element to show the image selected. this element must have the ID _meme-image_;

> The element where the image is uploaded must be identified with the ID _meme-insert_. This element doesn't need to be inside the container;

> The image must be fully contained inside the element identified as _meme-image-container_ (it means the it can't be any space left between the container and the image, and the image can't be bigger than the container);
