### Day 1-3 - Unix & Bash - Part-1

On this day I learned basic commands to access the Linux terminal.

This directory contains the codes I used to complete the exercises, which were:


#### Part I - Creating files and directories

Hint: To create empty file you can use the command `touch` _name-of-the-folder.extension_

1. Using the terminal, aply the command to make a directory that you learned, make a folder called _unix-tests_ and enter it.

2. Create a text file named _trybe.txt_.

3. Create a copy of the file _trybe.txt_ with the name _trybe-backup.txt_.

4. Rename the file _trybe.txt_

5. Inside _unix-tests_, create a new directory called _backup_.

6. Move the file _trybe-backup.txt_ to the _backup_ directory.

7. Inside _unix-tests_, create a new directory called _backup2_.

8. Move the file _trybe-backup.txt_ from the _backup_ directory to the _backup2_ directory.

9. Erase the _backup_ directory.

10. Rename the _backup2_ directory to _backup_.

11. See the path to the current directory and list all its content.

12. Erase the _backup_ directory.

13. Clean the terminal.

To the exercises 14 and 15, create a text file with the content below called _skills.txt_ (no need to use the terminal for this):

Internet
Unix
Bash
HTML
CSS
javaScript
React
SQL

14. Show on the screen the first 5 skill in the file _skills.txt_.

15. Show on the screen the last 4 skills in the file _skills.txt_.

16. Erase all the files that end in _.txt_


#### Part II - Manipulation & search

1. In _unix-tests_ directory, download a file with the name of all the countries in the world using the curl command below:

`curl -o countries.txt "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kalinchernev/486393efcca01623b18d/raw/daa24c9fea66afb7d68f8d69f0c4b8eeb9406e83/countries"`

2. Show all the content in the file _countries.txt_ on screen.

3. Show the content in the _countries.txt_ file, page by page, until you finz Zambia.

4. Show again the content in _countries.txt_ page by page, but now use the command to search for Zambia.

5. Search for Brazil in _countries.txt_.

6. Search again for brazil, but now using _lower case_.

7. To the next exercises, create a new file called _phrases.txt_ and add a few phrases inside (no need to do this from the terminal).

8. Search through the phrases that doesn't contain the word fox.

9. Count the number of words in the file _phrases.txt_.

10. Count the number of lines in the file _prases.txt_.

11. Create the files _empty.tbt_ and _empty.pdf_.

12. List all _unix-tests_ contents.

13. List all the files that end with _.txt_

14. List all the files that end with _.txt_ or _.txt_.
