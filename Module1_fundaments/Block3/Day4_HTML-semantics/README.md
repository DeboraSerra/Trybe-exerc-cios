# Day 3-4 - Semantic HTML

### Block elements and inline elements

#### Fixing exercise (exercise1-3.4.html)

To make this exercise, read carefully. After understanding the exercise, develop the solution and than check to see if you were able to make what was asked.

1 - To make this exercise copy the HTML. After that, implement the CSS properties and, if necessary, make some additions to the existing HTML structure so the result will be similar to the _reference-image.png_ in the image directory.

Remember that the page structure must be the same so the samantics of the code will be mantained.

#### Now practice (index2.html, style.css)

The goal of this exercise is to practice what you just learned about semantic HTML.

For that, we will create a page the introduces one of the most impressive animals in the world: the Mantis Shrimp. The style of the page is up to you. üòâ

1 - Add a header to the page containing the title "Soco a 80km/h: Conhe√ßa o Stomatopoda" (80km/h punch: Meet the Mantis Shrimp).
2 - Add a set of links that represent the navegation area of the site.
  * Create a link called "P√°gina Inicial" (Home page).
  * Create a link called "Sobre" (About).
  * Create a link called "Contato" (Contact).
3 - Create an article that will contain the interesting facts about Stomatopode. The article will have a subtitle "Fatos sobre o Stomatopoda" (Facts about the Mantis Shrimp).
4 - Divide the article in sections, organizing the following way:
  * A first section containing general informations about the animal. The subtitle to this section is up to you. This section must contain its scientific name, which is _Odontodactylus scyllarus_, in italix. Beside this, it needs to have a table with its scientific classification, specifically: "Reino , Filo , Subfilo , Classe , Subclasse e Ordem" (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus and Species).
  *  The other sections are about the interesting facts that you choose about the animal. For each fact you create a new section.
  * Add, for each section, a subtitle referring to the chosen fact.
  * Add, to each section, one or more paragraphs describing the chosen fact. Highlight  the impressive characteristics referring to the fact you chose, in a way to reinforce the unicity of the Mantis Shrimp. For exemple: if you create a sectio detailing the potent punch of the animal, it would be interesting to highlight the speed of that punch (80km/h) in bold letters.
  * Add, for each section, an image, to ilustrate the fact.
  * Add, at last, a bibliographic references section, containing a list of all the links that were used as base to compile the page in question.
5 - Add a side content to the article, making available a link to the video, that shows the animal in action.
6 - Add a footer to the page, showing something like:
> "Conte√∫do compilado por <insere seu nome>, <ano atual>" (Content compiled by <your name>, <year>).

Obs: to this exercise, its mandatory to use, at least, 6 elements with the following tags: header , nav , article , section , h1 , h2 , h3, aside , footer , table e img.
