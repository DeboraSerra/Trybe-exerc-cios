2 - Create a file on the same directory and name it _style.css_.
3 - On this _.css_ file, add the styles so:
  * The text in the tags `h1` e `p` are aligned on the center.
  * The background color of your list change when the cursor is over the item.
  * The font of the item change when it is clicked.
4 - Add an unordered list with, at least, 3 characteristcs that you like.
5 - On _style.css_ file, add the property `list-style: none` to both lists.

### Combinations and descendants classes 

#### Fixing exercise (exercise5-3.3.html, style5.css)

Create the file _style.css_ and make the following exercises:
1 - Make all the item of Ordered Lists have a yellow background color. If the item's number is EVEN, make the font color green. If the number is ODD, use the property `text-tranform` to make the text uppercase. (Hint: combine classes might be useful here).
2 - Make all the `header` tags (`h1`, `h2`...) have font color red and, if any of them is in italic, increase it's size to 40px and put a 1px, solid and black border.
3 - Make all the `li` tags have 20px for font-size and, to all italic text inside a `li` tag, use the property font-weight to make it bold.
4 - On the programming languages list, make so the 3 first of the list have a font color blue and, if any of them have "java*" in the text, use a background color pink.
5 - (Bonus) To every link on the developer person allies list, make so the text gets bold and have the font color "theme of the site" when you pass the mouse over each one of them.
Hint 1: Use the selector `:hover` to control the when the mouse is over the item.
Hint 2: Standard colors sugestion. StackOverflow (orange), W3Schools (green), MDN (black), DevDocs (yellow), Trybe (green).
