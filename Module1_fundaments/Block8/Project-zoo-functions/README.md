# Project Zoo Functions

This project was ment to simulate different softwares that would be necessary in a zoo. The requisites below were followed and the project was developed following the principles of TDD.

1. Implement the function `getSpeciesById`.

> This function is responsible by the search of the animals using their ID.

2. Implement the function `getAnimalsOlderThan`.

> This function, starting with a sepecie's name and a minimal age, checks if all the animal of that specie are older than the age specified.

3. Implement the function `getEmployeeByName`.

4. Implement the function `getRelatedEmployees`.

> This function must verify if an employee is manager or not and then get the employees this person is responsible for, if he/her is manager, or throw an error, if he/she isn't.

5. Implement the function `countAnimals`.

As a personal project, I decided to use de codes into an html page simulating a real zoo.
