# Day 19.1 - Using containers - Docker

As exercise we were oriented to follow the directions below:

1. On Docker Hub, find the image for the Linux distribution Debian;

2. Once you find the oficial image, access it and check if there is any command to pull the image locally without having to create a container for that;

3. Pull the image using the tag _stable-slim_;

4. Create and execute a container in interactive mode using this image as reference;

5. On the container terminal, run the command `cat /etc/*-release`, that will return the Debian distribution that is running inside the container;

6. Exit the terminal;

7. Check the list of containers to see the one you just finished;

8. Restart the contsainer and see if it is active on the list of containers;

9.  Resume the container that was creates;

10. Run the command `cat /etc/debian_version`, that will return the current version of the system in the container;

11. Exit the terminal;

12. Remove the container created to this exercise;

13. (Bonus) Create and run in interactive mode and 'Cleanup' mode the image `andrius/ascii-patrol`;

14. (Bonus) Finish the container using `ctrl + c`.
