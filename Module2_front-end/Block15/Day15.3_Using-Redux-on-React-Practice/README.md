# Day 15.3 - Using Redux in React - Practice

We were given a repository with instructions to the exercises.

## Bonus

As a bonus, we followed the orientations below:
Create a client register system with 4 pages:

* The first page must be the Home page and have a Link to the user go to the Login page
* The second must be The Login page. There must be 2 fields to the user data (email and password). After the login, the user must be redirected to the registered clients.
  * If the login isn't done or if the user type the path name manually, the message must be "User not logged"
* the Registered clients page must list all the clients and a button to go to the register page. If there is no client there must be a message "No clients registered" and the button.
* The Register page must have 3 inputs to get the client data (name, age and email) and a button to register. There must also be a button to redirect the client to the Registered clients page.

#### Bonus to the bonus

* Implement the functionalities to register the clients.
* In the registered clients page, create a button to order the clients name alphabetically. Case the button is clicked again the original order must be shown.
* Each register must have a button with the text _X_. If the button is clicked, the register must be deleted.
