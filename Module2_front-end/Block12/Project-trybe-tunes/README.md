# [Prject TrybeTunes](https://deboraserra.github.io/project-trybe-tunes/)

In this project we were provided the codes to make a requisition to a music API so we can get the albums for an artist or a band and the user can select one of them to hear the preview to the musics. The user can also choose the ones that are his or her favorite and this information is saved to the page _Favorites_.

They can also see and edit their profile and it will be saved when they  open the page again.
