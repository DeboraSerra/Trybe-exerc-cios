# Day 11.1 - State components and events

## Fixing exercises
### Introduction to events (Fancy-buttons.js)

1. Create a React app and create a component that has a button associated to an event that prints any text using `console.log()`.

2. Now change your component so it shows three buttons side by side with different texts. Each button must trigger a different event, writing a text in the browser cconsole using `console.log()`.

### Binding functions to classes with `this` and `bind` on `constructor` (Fancy-buttons-refactor.js)

3. Refactor the previous exercise with the functions inside the class.

4. Make sure your functions have access to the `this` object.
