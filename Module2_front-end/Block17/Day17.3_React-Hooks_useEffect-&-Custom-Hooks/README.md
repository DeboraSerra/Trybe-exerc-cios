# Day 17.3 - React Hooks - useEffect and Custom Hooks

##### (fixing-exercises17.3)

For the fixing exercise 1 we were oriented to create a component and follow the guidelines below:

1. It generate a random number from 1 to 100 every 10 seconds.
2. If the number is multiple of 3 or 5, a message 'Hit!' must be shown.
3. The 'Hit!' message must be removed after 4 seconds.
4. The timer must be removed when the component is unmounted.

For the fixing exercise 2 we were oriented to create a to do list application and create a custom hook called `useArray` to manipulate the data stored on the list.

For the exercises one and two we were given a repository to follow the guidelines below:
1. Refactor the exercise using Hooks. Turn every class component into function components.

2. The guides to the exercises 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 are in the repository.
