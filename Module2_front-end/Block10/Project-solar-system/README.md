# Project Solar System

In this project we were asked to develop a react application to show the planets on our Solar System and a section to show the missions to planets and space.

As a personal project, I implemented a function to show the missions to a specific planet when the user click on it.

The first GIF shows how the application works with my personal implementation.

The second GIF shows the project without my personal implementation.
