# Day 4-1 - Fixing exercises - JavaScript - First steps

#### _[Variables](https://github.com/DeboraSerra/Trybe-exercicios/blob/main/Module_fundaments/Block4/Day1_first-step/Fixing-exercises/fixingExercise1-4.1.js)_

1 - Create a constant called 'myName' and assign to it your name.
2 - Create a constant called 'birthCity' and assign to it your birth city.
3 - Create a variable called 'birthYear' and assign to it the year you were born.
4 - Use the `console.log()` to print the constant and variables you created.
5 - Change the value assigned to the variable 'birthYear' to '2030'. Use `console.log(birthYear)` again to see what happens!
6 - Change the value assigned to the constant 'birthCity'. Use `console.log(birthCity)` again! Would you know how to explain why we receive an error message? ü§î

#### _[Primitive types, dynamic typing and arithmetic operations](https://github.com/DeboraSerra/Trybe-exercicios/blob/main/Module_fundaments/Block4/Day1_first-step/Fixing-exercises/fixingExercise2-4.1.js)_

1 - Create a constant called 'base' and a variable called 'height' and assign the values: 5 and 8.
2 - Create a constant called 'area' and assign to it the result of base multiplied to the height. Hint: remember to always use the `console.log()` to print the variables and check the result of the operations!
3 - Create a constant called 'perimeter' and assign to it the sum of all the sides of the rectangle.

#### _[If and Else conditions](https://github.com/DeboraSerra/Trybe-exercicios/blob/main/Module_fundaments/Block4/Day1_first-step/Fixing-exercises/fixingExercise3-4.1.js)_

1 - Create a constant that receive the score of a candidate in a tecnial challenge, and assign to it a value between 1 and 100;
2 - Use logic to verify if the candidate was aproved, reproved or wait-listed. For that, consider the following informations:
  * If the score is equal or bigger than 80, print "Parab√©ns, voc√™ foi aprovada(o)!" (Congratulations, you are aproved!);
  * If the score is less than 80 and bigger of equal to 60, print "Voc√™ est√° na nossa lista de espera" (You are on the wait list);
  * If the score is less than 60, print "Voc√™ foi reprovada(o)" (you are reproved);
3 - Create a conditional structure using if, else if and else to create your algorithm, and the logical operators that apply to each situation.
4 - Change the score value to see if the conditions work;

#### Logic Operators

1. _[Oparator _AND_](https://github.com/DeboraSerra/Trybe-exercicios/blob/main/Module_fundaments/Block4/Day1_first-step/Fixing-exercises/fixingExercise4-4.1.js)_

1 - Create a constant called "currentHour" that receive a number between 4 e 24, to represent the hour of the day.
2 - Create a variable called"message" that, initially, is an empty string.
3 - Set conditions so:
  * If the hour is bigger or equal to 22, insert "N√£o dever√≠amos comer nada, √© hora de dormir" (We shoudn't eat anything, it's time to sleep) in "message".
  * If the hour is bigger or equal to 18 and less than 22, insert the message "Rango da noite, vamos jantar :D" (Let's have dinner!) in "message".
  * If hour is bigger or equal to 14 and less than 18, insert "Vamos fazer um bolo pro caf√© da tarde?" (Let's make a cake to the afternoon snack?) in "message".
  * If hour is between 11 and 14, insert "Hora do almo√ßo!!!" (Lunch time!!!) in "message".
  * If hour is between 4 and 11, insert "Hmmm, cheiro de caf√© rec√©m passado" (huuuummm, smells like fresh coffee) in "message".
4 - Now print the variable 'message' after your conditions.

2. _[Operator _OR_](https://github.com/DeboraSerra/Trybe-exercicios/blob/main/Module_fundaments/Block4/Day1_first-step/Fixing-exercises/fixingExercise5-4.1.js)_

1 - Create a variable called "weekDay" that receive the string "quarta-feira".
2 - Use conditions so:
  * If the variable "weekDay" is "segunda-feira", "ter√ßa-feira", "quarta-feira", "quinta-feira" or "sexta-feira" (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thirsday or friday), print "Oba, mais um dia de aprendizado na Trybe >:D" (Yay! One more day of learning on Trybe!).
  * If it is any day of the weekend, print "FINALMENTE, descanso merecido UwU" (Finally, an earned rest).

#### _[Switch and Case](https://github.com/DeboraSerra/Trybe-exercicios/blob/main/Module_fundaments/Block4/Day1_first-step/Fixing-exercises/fixingExercise6-4.1.js)_

1 - Create a variable to store the status of the candidate on the selective process, which can be: 'aprovada' , 'lista' or 'reprovada' (approved, listed or reproved);
2 - Create a condition structure using switch/case that will print the message from the previous exercise if the status of the candidate is 'aprovada' , 'lista' or 'reprovada' . As default, print the message 'n√£o se aplica' (Do not apply).
